This if check if it run or no to make server always open .
as if u reboot vm ware will receive it as power off machine so server die ðŸ˜‚ .
so I used this trick .
also vmrun start "path to vmx  of machine which u created in vmware" .
Yeah also I used c  to use it as bin as bash crash in Ubuntu autostart .
after compiling better to move it to /usr/bin and rename it as u like.
then pick it from autostart

oof sorry guys : I forgot .
u will need to edit suderoes :
sudo visudo , change ALL to  NOPASSWORD:ALL*/
